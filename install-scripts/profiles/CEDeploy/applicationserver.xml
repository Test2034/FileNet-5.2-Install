        <description>WebSphere administrative security is enabled:
============================
You have two options for creating the appserver_admin user account. You can use the local file-based account usually defined while creating the WebSphere profile. Or, you can use WebSphere tools to grant administrative rights to an LDAP account and optionally remove the file-based account created earlier. The appserver_admin user account must have WebSphere administrator permissions throughout the Content Platform Engine installation process. Afterwards, you can reduce the account to a lesser role, such as Configurator.

WebSphere administrative security is not enabled:
==============================
If you decide not to enable WebSphere administrative security during profile creation, then no special credentials are required to log in to the WebSphere admin console. You can enter any string into the Configuration Manager field labeled Application server administrator user name. However, remember that to run Content Platform Engine, WebSphere administrative security must be enabled. When you do enable it and the WebSphere admin console requests an account to use as the admin user, enter the appserver_admin.</description>
